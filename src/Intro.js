    <h2>Yoni Slotwiner</h2>
    <p>I'm a software developer passionate about the intersection of product, operations, and customer service. I'm particularly interested in developing technology that improves people's lives.</p>
    <p>For the past few years I worked at Uber, where I helped lead the regional Greenlight Hubs (in-person support centers for drivers). While there I became increasingly interested in the technology side of the operation, which is why I eventually decided to leave the company and dedicate myself to learning software development.</p>
    <p>Since then, I've completely immersed myself in the programming world, and every day I look forward to building, learning, and collaborating.</p>
